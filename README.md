# Create an iOS application

> We have applications available for [Node.js Express](https://github.com/IBM/node-express-app), [Go Gin](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app), [Python Django](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-app), [Swift Kitura](https://github.com/IBM/swift-kitura-app), [Android](https://github.com/IBM/android-app), and [iOS](https://github.com/IBM/ios-app).

In this sample, you will create an iOS application complete with standard best practices built for IBM Cloud.

## Steps

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can run the application natively.

#### Native Application Development

- Install the latest [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) 11.0+ version.
- iOS 12.0+
- Swift 5.0


To run your application locally:

The IBM Cloud Mobile services SDK uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to manage and configure dependencies.

You can install CocoaPods using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If the CocoaPods repository is not configured, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod setup
```

For this starter, a pre-configured `Podfile` is included in the **ios_swift/Podfile** location. To download and install the required dependencies, run the following command in the **ios_swift** directory:

```bash
$ pod install
```
Open the Xcode workspace: `{APP_Name}.xcworkspace`. Continue to open the `.xcworkspace` file as it contains all the dependencies and configurations.

If you run into any issues during the pod install, it is recommended to run a pod update by using the following commands:

```bash
$ pod update
$ pod install
```

Click **Product > Run** to start the app in Xcode.

Your application will be running within your chosen device emulator.
